This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

## A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset. 

A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: [Web Link]

An updated version of this dataset can be found at [Web Link]. It includes labels of postural transitions between activities and also the full raw inertial signals instead of the ones pre-processed into windows. 

## Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

      Contains all features.
3. activity_labels.txt
      Links the class labels with their activity name.
4. X_train.txt
      Training data
5. y_train.txt
      Training labels.

## Data packages needed to install
data.table()

## Activity names to name the activities in the data set
They come from activity_labels.txt
We read them into RStudio in  activities <- read.table("activity_labels.txt")
and incorporate into the merged data set later in the run_analysis.R script
These names are      
      WALKING
      WALKING_UPSTAIRS
      WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
      SITTING
      STANDING
      LAYING

## Names of the attributes in the merged data set are as following

# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names

After step1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, step2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, step3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. In step4, we create a tidy data set from the merged data set as a separate text file and named it "merged_clean_data.txt".
